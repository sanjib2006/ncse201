There are three foundational items of STL:
1. Containers
2. Algorithms
3. Iterators

## Containers
Containers are objects that hold other objects.

- `vector` defines a dynamic array
- `deque` creates a double-ended queue
- `list` creates a linear list
- `map` provides access to values (associative container) with unique keys

## Algorithms
Algorithms act on containers. They provide the means by which elements in a container can be manipulated.

## Iterators
Iterators are objects that are used to cycle through the contents of a container.
